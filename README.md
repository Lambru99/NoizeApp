# NoizeApp
This is a java pc app developed by Ludovico Latini and based on https://github.com/kartiknair/noize and https://noize.ml.

If you want to run my program you need to create a new folder in the root of the program called media and you need to add 10 songs named a1.mp3-a10.mp3.

I also use a javafx library so you need to download it.
